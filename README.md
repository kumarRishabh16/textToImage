# textToImage
This is a project that demonstrates the usage of text-to-image generation using the DALL-E API chatGPT. The project allows users to input a text prompt, which is then passed to the DALL-E API to generate an image. The generated image is then displayed to the user. #chatgpt

The project is built using the Django web framework and includes a user-friendly interface for inputting the text prompt. It can be a helpful example for developers who are interested in using text-to-image generation in their own projects, and also to understand the working of DALL-E API.
